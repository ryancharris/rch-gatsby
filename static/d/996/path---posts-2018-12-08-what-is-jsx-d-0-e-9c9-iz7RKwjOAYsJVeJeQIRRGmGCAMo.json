{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As developers, we use a variety of tools and open source packages to make our jobs easier. Some of them are so widely used throughout the community that they seem native to JavaScript. Though they're not, they can fundamentally change how you write code on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>One of these technologies that you're already using is JSX, a XML like syntax extension for JavaScript. Created by the wizards at Facebook, it is intended to simplify the developer experience. As the spec says, the rationale for creating JSX was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"…to define a concise and familiar syntax for defining tree structures with attributes.\" ~ JSX Spec</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, you're probably saying to yourself, \"Hey, Ryan, this sounds great, but <strong>get to the code already</strong>\", so here's our first example.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const helloWorld = &#x3C;h1>Hello, World!&#x3C;/h1>;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that's it! The snippet above looks familiar, but have you ever stopped to think about its power? JSX makes it so we can <strong>pass around tree structures composed of HTML or React elements as if they were standard JavaScript values</strong>. Crazy!</p>\n<p>While you don't have to use JSX when writing React (or use React in order to try JSX), there's no denying it is an important part of the React ecosystem, so let's dive in and see what's going on under the hood!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"Dec. 08, 2018","title":"What the heck is JSX?","attachments":[{"publicURL":"/static/macbook-f701eb7b00b50f27f602efea12ac1672.jpg"}]},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"posts/2018-12-08-what-is-jsx/"}}
